      <h1>Events</h1>
      <p>
        Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are
        programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them
        in some way if desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to
        respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this case,
        the button click is the event, and displaying the information box is the
        response to the event.
      </p>
      <p>React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.</p>
      <p>
        With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
      </p>
      <p>React events are written in camelCase syntax:</p>
      <p>onClick instead of onclick</p>
      <p>React event handlers are written inside curly braces:</p>
      <p>onClick=&#123;this.myFunc&#125;</p>
