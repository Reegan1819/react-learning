      <h1>What is Next.js?</h1>
      <p>
        Next.js is a React framework that provides a set of tools and
        conventions for building React applications. It is designed to make
        building React applications easier and more efficient by providing
        features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and route
        pre-fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR),
        static site generation (SSG), and other advanced features for building
        fast and scalable web applications. It simplifies React development by
        providing a built-in routing system, code splitting, and API routes,
        among other features

      <h2>What are the benefits of using Next.js?</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js offers several benefits for building React applications,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO</li>
        <li>Automatic code splitting for faster page loads</li>
        <li>Route pre-fetching for faster navigation</li>
        <li>
          Static site generation (SSG) for improved performance and security
        </li>
        <li>Built-in routing system for easier navigation</li>
        <li>API routes for building backend services</li>
        <li>File-based routing for easier code organization</li>
        <li>Support for TypeScript and CSS modules</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js?</h2>
      <p>
        Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used to render web pages on
        the server before sending them to the client. This can improve
        performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered pages to the client
        instead of relying on client-side JavaScript to render the page.
      </p>
      <h2>How do you deploy a Next.js application?</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js applications can be deployed using a variety of hosting services
        and platforms, including Vercel, Netlify, and AWS. These platforms offer
        integrations with Next.js that make it easy to deploy and scale
        applications, as well as monitor performance and manage deployments.
