      <h2>What is React?</h2>
      <p>
        React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011.
        It follows the component-based approach that helps in building reusable
        UI components. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and
        mobile UI. Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of
        the largest communities supporting it.

      <p>
        <strong>JSX:</strong> JSX is a syntax that is used to write HTML within
        JavaScript. It makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Components:</strong> React is all about components. You need to
        create small components that are reusable and composable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unidirectional data flow:</strong> React follows the
        unidirectional data flow or one-way data binding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Single-way data flow:</strong> React follows the single-way data
        flow or one-way data binding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React creates an in-memory data structure
        cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the
        browser's displayed DOM efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance:</strong> React uses a virtual DOM that makes the
        user experience better and the developer's work faster.
