        React is a JavaScript library that builds fast and interactive mobile
        and web applications. It is an open-source, reusable component-based
        front-end library of JavaScript. React is a combination of HTML and
        JavaScript. It provides a robust and opinionated way to build modern
        applications.

        JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. JSX is a combination of HTML
        and JavaScript. Components are the building blocks of React. Components
        are reusable and can be nested inside other components. One-way data
        binding is a way to bind data from the component to the view. Virtual
        DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. Virtual DOM is faster than
        the real DOM. React Native is a framework for building mobile
        applications. React Router is a routing library for React. React Redux
        is a library for managing the state of an application. React Hooks are
        functions that let you use state and other React features. React Context
        is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass
        props down manually at every level. React Fiber is a complete rewrite of
        the React core algorithm.

      <h2>Disadvantages of React</h2>
      <p>
        JSX is a bit complex and needs time to understand. It can be difficult
        for beginners to understand JSX. React is a library, not a full
        framework. React's community is smaller than Angular's community.
        React's library is too large. React is not secure. React does not
        support IE8.
