      <p>
        React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the
        navigation among views of various components in a React Application,
        allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        React Router provides a <code>BrowserRouter</code> component, which is a
        wrapper around the <code>history</code> API. It keeps the UI in sync
        with the URL by using the <code>history</code> API to keep track of the
        current location.
      </p>
      <p>
        React Router provides a <code>Route</code> component, which is used to
        render a component based on the URL. It takes two props:{" "}
        <code>path</code> and <code>component</code>. The <code>path</code> prop
        is used to match the URL, and the <code>component</code> prop is used to
        render the component when the URL matches the path.
      </p>
      <p>
        React Router also provides a <code>Link</code> component, which is used
        to navigate to a different URL. It takes a <code>to</code> prop, which
        is the URL to navigate to.
      </p>

      <p>
        React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React
        applications. It enables developers to create single-page applications
        with dynamic, client-side routing. Instead of relying on server-side
        routing, where each request to the server triggers a new page load,
        React Router allows navigation within the application without reloading
        the entire page. This results in a faster, more seamless user
        experience.

      <h2>Key Features of React Router</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Declarative routing</li>
        <li>Dynamic routing</li>
        <li>Nested routing</li>
        <li>Route parameters</li>
        <li>Programmatic navigation</li>
        <li>Protected routes</li>
        <li>Route transitions</li>
        <li>History management</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        React Router provides a declarative way to define the routes in your
        application. Instead of manually handling URL changes and rendering
        components based on the URL, you can define the routes using the
        <code>Route</code> component. This makes it easier to manage the routing
        logic and keep the UI in sync with the URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        React Router supports dynamic routing, which allows you to render
        different components based on the URL. You can use route parameters to
        capture dynamic segments of the URL and pass them as props to the
        rendered components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nested routing is another key feature of React Router. You can nest
        routes within other routes to create a hierarchy of views in your
        application. This is useful for building complex layouts with multiple
        levels of navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Route parameters allow you to capture dynamic segments of the URL and
        pass them as props to the rendered components. This is useful for
        building dynamic routes that respond to changes in the URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        React Router provides a programmatic API for navigating between routes.
        You can use the <code>useHistory</code> hook to access the history
        object and navigate to different routes programmatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protected routes are routes that require authentication before rendering
        the component. React Router provides a way to protect routes by wrapping
        them in a higher-order component that checks if the user is
        authenticated before rendering the component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Route transitions are animations that occur when navigating between
        routes. React Router provides a way to define route transitions using
        CSS animations or JavaScript libraries like React Transition Group.
      </p>
        <p>
            History management is another key feature of React Router. It allows you
            to control the browser history and navigate between routes using the
            browser's back and forward buttons. This is useful for creating a
            seamless user experience and maintaining the application's state across
            different routes.
