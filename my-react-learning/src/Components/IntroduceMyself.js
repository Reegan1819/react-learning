        "Hi, I am Reegan, and I have over 5 years of experience in front-end
        development using React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Material
        UI, Next.js, and TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 5 years, I have worked on various projects, including an
        OTT platform, a food recipe app, a health solution, a banking
        application, and a career portal. My diverse project experience has
        helped me develop a well-rounded skill set and the ability to tackle
        different types of challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        My most recent project was a career portal designed for students who
        have completed courses at their academy. This portal was developed using
        React.js and included several modules such as a dashboard, job listings,
        recommended jobs, job applications, and user profiles.
      </p>
      <h3>About this project:</h3>
      <p>
        The career portal was a comprehensive solution that aimed to help
        students find job opportunities tailored to their skills and education.
        The modules included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Job listings: Displays available job positions.</li>
        <li>
          Dashboard: Provides an overview of the user’s activity and updates.
        </li>

        <li>
          Recommended Jobs: Suggests job opportunities based on the user’s
          profile and preferences.
        </li>
        <li>Job Applications: Allows users to apply for jobs.</li>
        <li>
          Profile Management: Enables users to create and update their profiles
          with relevant information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
      <p>
        One of the significant challenges I faced was implementing the job
        application and profile management pages, which involved complex logic
        and numerous scenarios. To address these challenges, I researched best
        practices from similar applications and worked diligently to ensure that
        the functionality was robust and user-friendly. Through this process, I
        learned a great deal about optimizing application performance and
        managing complex state and logic in React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, my experience has taught me the importance of attention to
        detail, effective collaboration, and continuous learning. I am
        passionate about creating efficient, scalable, and user-centric web
        applications."
