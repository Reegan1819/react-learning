      <h2>What is TypeScript and how is it different from JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>
        TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the
        language. This allows developers to catch errors at compile time rather
        than at runtime, which can help improve code quality and
        maintainability. TypeScript also provides features such as interfaces,
        enums, and decorators that are not available in JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the benefits of using TypeScript?</h2>
      <p>There are several benefits to using TypeScript, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Static typing: TypeScript adds static types to JavaScript, which can
          help catch errors at compile time and improve code quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code maintainability: TypeScript's static types can make code easier
          to understand and maintain, especially in large codebases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced tooling: TypeScript provides tools such as code completion,
          refactoring, and type checking that can improve developer
          productivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compatibility: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so existing
          JavaScript code can be gradually converted to TypeScript without
          breaking existing functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Community support: TypeScript has a large and active community that
          provides resources, libraries, and tools to help developers get
          started and be successful with the language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Static type checking Enhanced IDE support and autocompletion Improved
        refactoring capabilities Better code documentation Early detection of
        errors Use of modern JavaScript features through transpilation

      <h2>Explain the concept of "types" in TypeScript.</h2>
      <p>
        In TypeScript, types are used to define the shape of data and the
        operations that can be performed on that data. Types can be primitive
        types such as number, string, and boolean, or more complex types such as
        arrays, objects, and functions. Types can also be combined to create
        custom types that represent specific data structures or behaviors.
        <p>
          Types in TypeScript define the shape and behavior of data. They allow
          developers to specify what kind of data a variable or function can
          accept, reducing the chances of runtime errors. TypeScript includes
          basic types (e.g., number, string, boolean), complex types (e.g.,
          arrays, tuples), and custom types (e.g., interfaces, type aliases).
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>What is an interface in TypeScript?</h2>
      <p>
        An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the shape of an object. It
        specifies the properties and methods that an object must have in order
        to be considered an instance of a particular type. Interfaces can be
        used to enforce a contract between different parts of a program and to
        provide type checking and code documentation.
      </p>
      <h2>What are access modifiers in TypeScript?</h2>
      <p>
        Access modifiers in TypeScript are keywords that control the visibility
        and accessibility of class members. There are three access modifiers in
        TypeScript: public, private, and protected.
      </p>
      <h2>What are generics in TypeScript and how do they work?</h2>
      <p>
        Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable components that can
        work with a variety of data types. They enable you to define functions,
        classes, and interfaces that can operate on any type of data without
        losing type safety. Generics are defined using angle brackets and type
        parameters, which specify the types that a generic component can work
        with.
      </p>
      <h2>Explain the concept of type assertions in TypeScript.</h2>
      <p>
        Type assertions in TypeScript are a way to tell the compiler that you
        know more about the type of a value than it does. They are similar to
        type casting in other languages, but they do not change the underlying
        type of the value. Type assertions are typically used when working with
        values that have a more specific type than their inferred type.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What is the difference between "interface" and "type" in TypeScript?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In TypeScript, both interfaces and types can be used to define custom
        data structures, but they have some key differences. Interfaces are
        mainly used for defining object shapes and enforcing contracts, while
        types can be used for defining any kind of data structure, including
        primitive types, unions, and intersections. Interfaces can also be
        extended and implemented, while types can be aliased and combined.
